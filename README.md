# Simple Loan Classification

Classifying whether a person is eligble for loan or not.<br>
Some key factors that I found in this data are:-

<ul>
    <li>The dataset was small hence the name simple loan classification</li>
    <li>Occupation column had 38 unique values, which in my opinion won't help in the accuracy of the model</li>
    <li>Customers whose loan applications were denied had a lower average income as compared to those who had their loan applications approved</li>
    <li>This goes the same for credit score and age also.</li>
    <li>Young customer's loan applications weren't being approved as frequently as older customers</li>
</ul>
